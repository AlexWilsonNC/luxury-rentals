# Luxury Rentals

Luxury Rentals is an Interactive Full-Stack application that allows users to book rental cars.

## Description

The user is able to choose from a variety of high-end vehicles across four locations. To make a reservation, the user must login or create an account, then choose the car and location they want to book. As the user selects a start and end date for their rental period, the page consistently updates pricing information so the user can confirm their booking with confidence. That reservation will now be available in the user's history on their account page.
